### Hey There! Welcome to my humble engineer page.

I'm an avid full stack/front-end web developer, with a passion for creating great looking web pages, user interfaces,
APIs,and databases on cloud systems and more! 

Most of my professional work encompassed web apps and networked systems for other companies , but I soon realized
that I don't have much in the way of outreach and visible work for others to seen and enjoy. So I've decided to
push that envelope and create content about my wizard skills üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, of which this page is the start!

Slowly but surely I'll be producing web dev content for you all to enjoy!

### Some of my favorite quotes:

- "Software engineers are modern day wizards, quite literally - they digitally scribe archaic runes into stones that then 
compute whatever you want and do modern day magic."

- "Fear is a mile wide, and an inch deep."
	
- "If you can be in a bad mood for no reason, you can be in a good mood for no reason. 
If it's not going to change your life then it shouldn't change your mood. If the cost is peace of mind, don't buy it."
	
- "Your first workout will be bad. Your first podcast will be bad. Your first speech will be bad. 
Your first video will be bad. Your first ANYTHING will be bad. But you can't make your 100th without making your first.
So put your ego aside, and start."
