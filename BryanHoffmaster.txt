	<p>Hey There! Welcome to my humble engineer page.</p>

	<p>I'm an avid full stack web developer, with a passion for creating great looking web pages, user interfaces, APIs,
		and databases on cloud systems and more! </p>

	<p>Most of my professional work has been done with internal systems for companies large and small, but I soon
		realized
		that I don't have much in the way of outreach and visible work for others to seen and enjoy. So I've decided to
		push that envelope and create my own personal website, of which this page is going to be the start!

		<li>
			"<span class="slow-change-animation italic">Fear is a mile wide, and an inch deep.</span>"
		</li>
		<li>
			"<span class="slow-change-animation italic">If you can be in a bad mood for no reason, you can be in a good
				mood for no reason. If it's not going to change your life then it shouldn't change your mood. If the
				cost is peace of mind, don't buy it.</span>"
		</li>
		<li>
			"<span class="slow-change-animation italic">
				Your first workout will be bad.
				Your first podcast will be bad.
				Your first speech will be bad.
				Your first video will be bad.
				Your first ANYTHING will be bad.
				But you can't make your 100th without making your first.
				So put your ego aside, and start.</span>"
		</li>
