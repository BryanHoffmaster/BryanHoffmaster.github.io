This is a personal website page that was inspired by [this repo here](https://github.com/CodeNerve/CodeNerve.github.io/tree/masterZ). 

This is a work in progress that will be updated every so often in concert with my other professional works.

Feel free to copy and modify the code as you wish, but this should only be used for educational purposes only. Feel free to re-use my code or get inspired yourself!

Any likenesses of myself, including but not limited to my name and/or face are mine alone and can not be re-used.
